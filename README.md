# Operational-Research [SP]

+ **Category**: School Project
+ **Status**: Discontinued

## **Overview**

This project is a set of assignment we had to do for an introduction to Operational Research problems in an university class.  
We had to write algorithm to solve several computational problems (eg: job shop / hvrp) in heuristic time. This class was about mathematical optimisation and modelisation.

## **Goal / Requirements**

The goal was to solve several problems with algorithms that would run in a small enough time frame and produce accurate results.

Data were given in text files. Grades were given via a report we had to do to explain our solution, our problems and study our results.

## **Technologies**

+ C++
